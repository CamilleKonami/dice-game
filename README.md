#### Rules

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls 2 dices as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, his current score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his current score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- A player looses his entire score when he rolls two 6 in a row. Then it's the next player's turn.
- The players can set the winning scores in a field: the first player to reach it on GLOBAL score wins the game
